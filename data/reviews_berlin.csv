Unfortunately it seems very sterile to me during the day and the demarcation from the necessary parking area has not been successful in my opinion. The toilets in the pavilion are public, which at least I only realized after reading up on it. Unfortunately this is probably the case for others too, because you can smell it again and again in different places. The children's playgrounds do not seem to be popular either, hardly visited in my opinion. Nevertheless, it is a green spot in the city with very good logistical connections and several food and drink shops in the immediate vicinity. Why there are garbage cans only at the edge of the green area and not at all the seats remains a mystery. Accordingly, the garbage piles up in the evening. In summary, yes, it is worthwhile for a short rest, but if you don't mind the walk, you might prefer to walk a few meters further to Preu√üenpark/Thaipark.

The sponsoring association is the F√∂rderk reis Bohemian Village in Berlin-Neuk√∂lln e. V. The Prime Minister of Prague and the Governing Mayor of Berlin are the patrons of the garden.\n\nThe Comenius Garden is located on Richardstrasse in the heart of B√∂hmisch-Rixdorf. The neighborhood is home to descendants of the Bohemian religious refugees who were allowed to settle there in 1737.\n\nThe ""Richardsburg"", a notorious tenement block, has stood on the approximately 1.2 hectare site since 1905. After it was demolished in 1971, various usage concepts were considered. In the 1980s, planning for a Comenius Garden began. In 1992, the then Czech and Slovak Federative Republic expressed its gratitude for the reception of the Bohemians in the 18th century with a Comenius monument. Alexander Dubcek, then President of Parliament, unveiled it on the still unused site. The planning could then be pushed forward. The garden architects Cornelia M√ºller and Jan Wehberg designed the garden. The garden was opened in June 1995.\n\nThe garden is a scientific-historical reconstruction of the work of Johann Amos Comenius (1592‚Äì1670). This is reflected on two levels. On the one hand, a tour has been created that traces the life of a person; on the other, themes from various works and the scientific-historical environment of Comenius are taken up. The connection between Comenius and the garden is not visible - apart from the monument - but only becomes apparent in an oral explanation (or in the literature based on it). The design means come from the tradition of garden architecture. In addition to beds, meadows, an avenue and other plantings, a pond and a water basin were created, an arbor was built and sculptures were set up.

Literature.\nSachs grew up in a wealthy Jewish family and studied in Berlin lin literature and philosophy. Due to the persecution of the Jews by the National Socialists, she had to leave Germany in 1940 and emigrated to Sweden. She lived there until her death and worked as a writer and translator.\n\nHer poetry is influenced by themes such as the Holocaust, the suffering of the Jews and the pursuit of humanity. She also wrote plays and prose works that often contain autobiographical elements.\n\nNelly Sachs' work has been awarded numerous prizes, including the Georg B√ºchner Prize and the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade.

However, Bayrischer Platz has become a tragedy and a very clear reflection of the failure of Berlin politics (the public order office and police are clearly overwhelmed!!!). The benches on the green area of ‚Äã‚ÄãBayrischer Platz can unfortunately no longer be used because there is a sick homeless person there who thinks Bayrischer Platz is his home and the seats are his toilet. In other words, he does his business (whether big or small) on the seats below him or directly behind one of the seats. The Social Psychiatric Service st of Berlin Sch√∂neberg was called in but complies with the wishes of the homeless man who rejects the opportunity of a one-room apartment. Alcoholics throw their empty bottles behind or in front of the seats. The failure of Berlin politics and the Parks Department of Berlin Sch√∂neberg is nowhere in Sch√∂neberg more evident than at Bayrische Platz. If you consider the fact that Bayrische Platz is a historically important place (in terms of dealing with the Jewish population of Berlin Sch√∂neberg) then the failure of civil servants such as the local authority office and the police is a slap in the face to the Jewish population who have lived there for generations. Guests who come to Berlin and are interested in the history of Berlin are driven away by the smell of feces and the place having become a drug dealing hub and return home completely shocked. Caf√© Haberland with its documentation of former Jewish life in Berlin Sch√∂neberg on Bayrischer Platz is no help either, if you are sitting on the terrace (in sunshine) with a piece of cake and a cup of coffee and have to watch a helpless homeless person doing his business behind a bench or alcoholics throwing bottles around or getting new drugs. In short, Bayrischer Platz is well on its way to becoming a rival to Leopold Platz in Wedding and is not recommended for people (with or without children) who want to relax for a short moment!!! Thank you to the Berlin politicians who have the money to get a ride from Sch√∂neberg Town Hall to the Red Town Hall in Berlin but who explain in a subtle way to the residents of Bayrischer Platz that the money for a public toilet on Bayrischer Platz is being used. hen Platz is unfortunately missing and the public order office and the police are unfortunately understaffed 365 days a year. I advise travel companies (if you are interested in being recommended and want/need to earn money with your company) against Bayerischer Platz. And for parents with children or employees who also want to relax for a moment, I recommend Viktoria Luise Platz, which is only a few minutes' walk from Bayerischer Platz. As the amount can only be posted with one star, I will limit myself to one star, otherwise I would not give any stars at all as even the district management of Bayerischer Platz, which repeatedly tries to make the square look well-kept through voluntary work but quite obviously cannot assert itself against Berlin politics, has to watch helplessly as a good middle-class square becomes a ghetto stinking of feces. And let's not forget the body that was found in the bushes at Bayerischer Platz this year. It's great that the police in Berlin Section 4 had time to take all the necessary measures. Mr. Gennert and Mr. Haberland would turn in their graves knowing what has become of Berlin and Bayerischer Platz!!!

Unfortunately, a number of play and climbing equipment have been removed from the latter for some time, so that it is no longer so interesting for slightly older children.', 'Popular children's paddling pool at the ""Forcki""\nThe amusement park bears the name of a former mayor\n\nIf the When the thermometer shows summer temperatures again, the paddling pool on Forckenbeckplatz on the edge of the Samariterviertel in Friedrichshain, on the border with Prenzlauer Berg, will become a popular meeting place for children.\n\nSurrounded by crocodiles and turtles, two elephants will provide great fun, because they spit out the cooling water.\nNoc A few years ago, the amusement park had a problem with cleanliness, but after a thorough renovation and redesign, the condition has improved considerably. The square has now become a popular meeting place for young and old, for sun worshippers and barbecue fans. The sports facilities and the adventure and construction playground are particularly popular with children and young people.\n\nThe ""Forcki"", as Berliners affectionately call the square, was already a decorative square in 1895, when it was named after the former mayor of Berlin in the middle of dense residential development. Maximilian Franz August von Forckenbeck ran the office from 1878 to 1892. He is considered one of the most important mayors in Berlin because he achieved a lot for Berliners and their city through his prudent and economical leadership.\n\nThe main entrance to the former central cattle yard is located to the north of Forckenbeckplatz. This large building complex has been gradually being converted into Blankensteinpark since around 1995. It was city architect Hermann Blankenstein who was responsible for the development of the slaughterhouses in the 19th century, which helped to ensure the supply of Berliners. n.

I recently spent a few hours here and was truly captivated by its charm‚ÄîVi ktoria Park deserves all five stars.\n\nOne of the standout features of Viktoria Park is its stunning man-made waterfall. As you enter the park, the sight and sound of cascading water instantly transport you away from the hustle and bustle of Berlin. The waterfall, which was built in the 19th century, flows down from the top of the hill, where the National Monument for the Liberation Wars sits. This feature alone makes Viktoria Park feel more like a slice of natural wilderness than a typical city park. Surrounding the waterfall are paths and stairways leading up the hill, and it's well worth the short climb to fully appreciate the views and the tranquil atmosphere.\n\nAt the top of the hill, you'll find the National Monument, built in honor of the Prussian victory against Napoleon. From this vantage point, you can take in sweeping views of Berlin, stretching from Kreuzberg to other parts of the city. The view is particularly spectacular at sunset when the warm light blankets the cityscape, making it a perfect spot for both photographers and anyone who wants to simply pause and take in the city from above. For a free viewpoint, the experience rivals any paid observation deck in the city.\n\nViktoria Park is ideal for a picnic or just relaxing on the grass with friends, family, or a book. There are open lawns and shaded areas that provide the perfect setting for an afternoon retreat. Many locals bring snacks and blankets to enjoy a laid-back picnic here, which adds to the park‚Äôs welcoming vibe. It‚Äôs also pet-friendly, so you‚Äôll see people with their dogs, kids playing, and others just soaking in the greenery. It‚Äôs a favorite spot for Berliners, which speaks volumes about its appeal.\n\nUnlike some parks that can feel quiet or isolated, Viktoria Park strikes a balance between being peaceful yet lively. The park attracts a diverse crowd, from families to couples and groups of friends, making it a vibrant place to visit. On warm weekends, you might come across small gatherings, musicians playing live music, or even small events. There's a friendly, community-like atmosphere here that makes you feel at ease.\n\nThe surrounding Kreuzberg area is known for its eclectic cafes, bars, and restaurants, so if you're in the mood for a coffee or meal afterward, you're in luck. I enjoyed a walk around the neighborhood after my time in the park, exploring some of Berlin‚Äôs best street art, trendy cafes, and international food options ions. This adds a wonderful dimension to your visit, as you can easily make a whole day out of exploring Viktoria Park and the surrounding area.\n\nViktoria Park is well-maintained and easily accessible, with multiple entrances, clean paths, and seating areas . Despite its popularity, it‚Äôs clear that the park staff work hard to keep it clean and inviting. It‚Äôs also close to public transport, making it easy for tourists and locals alike to reach.\n\nViktoria Park offers an unforgettable experience that goes beyond the usual expectations of a city park. With its lush greenery, beautiful waterfall, panoramic city views, and lively atmosphere, it‚Äôs the perfect place to unwind, socialize, and take in some of Berlin‚Äôs best natural and urban scenery. Whether you‚Äôre a tourist or a local, this park is a must-visit, and I can‚Äôt recommend it highly enough.', 'A very pretty place to go.

There he saw a waterfall and he really liked it and he got a replica of the waterfalls done in this park and named the park in honor of his wife Viktoria a man made waterfall and it has been thoroughly done.

Our evening began on the charming patio, where the beautiful weather added an extra layer of enchantment to the night. From the moment we arrived, the staff's exceptional hospitality stood out. They welcomed us with genuine warmth and friendliness, immediately making us feel at home. Their extensive knowledge of the menu was impressive, and their eagerness to guide us through the culinary journey ahead heightened our anticipation. We started our meal with the grilled butter lettuce, an impeccable choice that set the tone for the rest of the evening. The dressing was extraordinarily flavorful, creating a delightful balance that tantalized our taste buds and left us eager for the next course. Next, we indulged in the beef tartar, which was simply perfect in every way. The texture, seasoning, and presentation were all executed flawlessly, making it a standout dish. For the main course, I faced a delightful dilemma between the braised ox shoulder and the BBQ ribs. In the end, I decided to indulge in both, and it proved to be the best decision of the night. Each dish was cooked to perfection, with the braised ox shoulder melting in my mouth and the BBQ ribs offering a succulent, smoky flavor that left me craving more. Rutz Zollhaus is a true culinary gem in Berlin, where every dish reflects the skill and creativity of Chef Marco M√ºller and his team. The entire dining experience was remarkable and memorable, from the impeccable service to the exquisite food. If you find yourself in Berlin, this is a must-visit restaurant. Bravo to Chef Marco M√ºller and the entire team for providing us with such an unforgettable experience. This evening will be one we remember fondly for years to come."", 'Mt meal, shoulder, was dry and hard. But my companions enjoyed their chicken and pork chop.', ""This place deserves to be mentioned when it comes to ( youshouldgothere)\n\nLet's start with the location:\nThe restaurant is located in Kreuzberg at the Carl-Herz-Ufer. There is almost no traffic but it's still very difficult finding a parking lot.\nUnfortunately, the restaurant is not large and the paths seem a bit narrow, which makes it feel cramped.\nThe ground floor is simply furnished and there is no real atmosphere .\nHere is what I recommend: the first floor. It is directly under the roof and the open beams create a very warm atmosphere which makes it very lovely.\n\nStaff:\nAll the waiters were very polite and respectful. They were quick and well organized.\n\nDishes:\nWhen it comes to food, it gets difficult because tastes are different.\nI can say this much. The starter and the dessert were not to my taste.\nThe main course (duck) was on point. The taste was great.\nBut again tastes are different.\n\nI know that there is a vineyard / beer garden (i.e. outdoor area) but unfortunately I can't say what it looks like there.\n\nThat's it.\ n\nWasn't th e last time for me. :)"", 'Food, wine, and service were all amazing. We loved the food. The wine pairings were very thoughtful. The service was attentive and helpful. The room was beautiful. The experience was a value on top of all that as well. Amazing!', 'Amazing experience last night dined in rutz ZollHaus. We were sitting upstairs, the table set up gorgeously, friendly lady explained the menu. HUGE wine selection, I got beef tarta and lamb for the main course, lamb cooked perfectly, the sauce was rich and full of flavors. For dessert I got the ‚Äúnearly apple cake‚Äù the dish was creative, lots of textures and layers!\nReally enjoyed, will bring my mum here when she comes visit', 'we had the best night with amazing wines and fantastic food. We took the 5 appetizers + one main+ desert and felt like we got a good idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe menu.', 'I would recommend this place higher if they weren‚Äôt so inflexible with their NYE dinner menu. I‚Äôm pregnant and require the main course, which is a beautiful steak to be done closer to well done. We didn‚Äôt request this upon making the reservation but didn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs not something a restaurant that charges ‚Ç¨190 per head for NYE menu can‚Äôt accommodate. Despite how apologetic our server was, apparently the kitchen refused to cook the steak further and kept it at medium rare. The steak didn't come out a little pink, but raw inside. I obviously couldn‚Äôt enjoy it and gave most of the meat to my husband. I'm very disappointed that they were very inflexible, otherwise the food was great. One note, I think the restaurant has a long way to go to refine their presentation and oversell services to be charging their guests ‚Ç¨190 per head. But the potential is there! (For example they served food on plates that have rough surface and all I heard during those courses were people scraping their plates which was very disturbing)', ""We celebrated my husband's Birthday in Rutz Zollhaus, and it was an amazing experience! From the ambience to the food and service, everything was impeccable. They even went out of their way to make a Birthday surprise for my husband, with song and everything. I would really recommend Rutz for any occasion, whether with a group, or intimate dinner for two. Although the steak prices might be a bit high, you also get a very nice quality of meat, cooked to perfection. Also if you are not willing to spend the money, there are way more affordable options in the menu as well. We'll have to come back in the summer, because the outside area looks cozy as well, overlooking the canal.\n\nThanks again for a night to remember <3"", 'What a great night I had there ! If you‚Äôre looking for a clearly refined German taste and cuisine, this is the place in Berlin !\n\nFlavors, colors and great staff are there for you. Highly recommend Rutz Rebell von Winning for the wine.\n\nFor desserts you can‚Äôt go wrong with anything.', 'Came here for a business dinner. The 5 course menu was excellent.

We will come back soon :)', 'We spent the evening outside and enjoyed the surprise tasting menu for about 75‚Ç¨ each. It consisted of many small starters that were either served alone or together. They lead to the main course, followed by desert.\n\nAll in all a satisfying experience with partly local produce and regional flavors.', 'One of the best restaurants I have dined in a long time. Wine, food, dessert and atmosphere were excellent. Staff was very knowledgeable about everything that the place had to offer. All of the suggestions were amazing to the taste. We had ox shoulder and fish dish. Delicious!!!!', ""While Rutz has 1 Michelin Star, I don't feel it is anyway more special or better than many other good restaurants without a star. The location is historic, however, rather bland. The service is good , however, rather bland. The food is good, however, nothing to write home about."", 'We recently had our wedding celebration here and booked out the whole place. I don't think we could have ever found a more perfect location. The restaurant and its wine garden are just so charming and made everything feel so magical. Everything was beyond perfect. The service staff were incredibly kind, super attentive, and very accommodating. The chefs produced truly beautifully presented and incredibly delicious courses for all of our guests. A special shout out to Pia who was our point of contact who organized everything for us and was so sweet. Truly an unforgettable experience. Thank you to everyone at Rutz Zollhaus.', 'Wonderful modern take on German food.', 'Fantastic meal. This beat the Michelin starred place I also went to on this Berlin trip. A must try! Get the full 7-course tasting menu, it‚Äôs perfectly portioned and every dish is phenomenal', 'If you are tired of Knackwurst or Schnitzel, try this place for a much more refined take on German cuisine. We called quite late in the evening to ask if they would still have us, which was no problem. On arrival we were immediately seated at the best place the cozy restaurant had (a corner table) by very friendly staff. Most dishes consist of typical German ingredients, but prepared much more refined than in your typical German restaurant. Prices are very affordable. Ask for the wine from their very own vineyard.', 'Kitchen couldnt accommodate a vegan in the group. Gave the vegan approx 1kg of iceberg salad and said there's nothing else that can be made for a main. A lack of effort or creativity or thoughtfulness that a place with this price point shouldn't have. Service was nice but not excellent otherwise, not being attentive with empty water etc', ""It was amazing. Incredible delicious. Haven't been in Berlin for like 6 years but this one takes the cake. Nom nom. Probably the best I have eaten this year."", ""Nice place and very friendly. We had the menu a cuisine presented and pimped in a refined way. Would go again if there weren't so many other places to explore in Berlin. What I liked is that we were welcome to eat even though it was a later hour (close to end of service), what I also really liked is that they had prepared us a table in the corner, with both of us facing the other tables complete with some cozy pillows. I hate how table placement is often that one person has a view and the other faces a wall. Not here, if there's room, they know how to accommodate couples."", 'Fantastic cozy restaurant with history. Delicious food and service. Well worth a visit.', 'Located by the river in an old customs house. It's modern German food with great ingredients and a cozy atmosphere. Lacked a little excitement perhaps but would go back for the exceptional Zander!!!', 'Facility is about basics and food is OK, service was excellent. Being a large group, the small crew did a great job. Infrastructure in general is pretty standard and compared to other similar features it really flies below. At a neighborhood apart from the action, makes this place kind a boring.', 'If you look for good food in Kreuzberg really next to Landwehrkanal, choose this wine garden. A small menu with simple dishes but revisited for this brasserie-style restaurant by 3star chef Rutz. To my taste, the service was a bit arrogant but still we had a nice evening with friends and good food and wine.', 'A really nice place to stay food in a nice atmosphere.

This is really a very good price/performance ratio. The individual courses were imaginative and perfectly matched to the wine. The service team was friendly and attentive. We particularly liked the relaxed atmosphere.', 'There were four of us eating here and we were all very satisfied. Only the grilled salad starter was a bit too rich, although it was very tasty, but there was little room in the stomach for other dishes. Everything was delicious, great combinations and interesting spices. Meat was super tender and delicate! Service was very courteous and active, but you should definitely not order water with lemon because lemons are not local. We recommend the restaurant and would be happy to come back !', 'Our spontaneous dinner on a Thursday was a wonderful experience. Cozy, warm, not too crowded and not too empty. The service was professional and really friendly and authentic, without any excessive fuss. And everything about the food was just right, it was really excellent.

The food was something very special and we are always happy when we are pleasantly surprised. We each chose the five starters, some of which were part of the surprise menu, including the Berlin blood sausage, the K√∂nigsberger Klopse and the tartare, which I particularly enjoyed.\nThe main course was the duck dish, which was also specially coordinated, and roast lamb with spinach in different preparations. This was served with a Riesling. For dessert I can recommend the sorbet, very tasty.\nAs I said, the whole thing has its (high) price, which you should take into account when making your choice, but in return you get first-class food.', 'The old customs house has been wonderfully refurbished in a fashionable design, a little different to the original, red towards the rough in the interior but still a modern, young team, we particularly liked the electronic music. But the highlight was of course the wine selection and the food and the advice they received. Exquisite dishes in full combination, one better than the other. The plates were scraped out', 'Siamo stati in this stupefacente ristorante durante la nostra vacanza berlinese ad agosto, quindi in a periodo dove il meteo permetteva di mangiare fuori, the location √® infatti con vista fiume, incastonato tra gli alberi, molto bello comunque anche internamente. The kitchen oscilla tra tradizione tedesca e rivisitazione in chiave moderna, ogni piatto provato √® stato interestingissimo e gustoso, dagli antipasti alla carne, dolci e vini tutto √® stato magnifico. This beautiful restaurant is the brother of Rutz, known and rated three Michelin stars. One of those places that ruins the trip!', 'It was simply brilliant. The food was super, super, delicious and the service was top class! Very attentive, friendly and human. This is exactly how a restaurant should be.', 'They can do it!\nVery fairly priced menu with good wines that were also reasonably priced.\nGood product quality + attractive presentation, without placing too much emphasis on haute cuisine.\nExceptionally professional service (what a comparison when you were served the night before by gruff, cool, English-speaking amateurs with a Berlin accent!) The service here is provided by professionals who enjoy their job and who are also interested in the guests and the products.\nThe only point deducted: the wooden bench becomes a bit uncomfortable after 2 hours... :-)\nI'd be happy to go back!', 'Great service: friendly, competent and fun.\nThe food was very fine. Not mainstream, something special and high quality.\nNot exactly cheap. With wine pairing, the two of us spent 300 euros. But in our opinion, it was absolutely fair.', 'We had the five-course menu with wine pairing. The food was great. Each course had its own speciality and the components were perfectly matched. There were three wines to go with it, but they were also h times. The explanations from the staff were rather brief. But that was probably because there was an event on the first floor. Overall, it was a very successful evening.', 'We really liked the little brother of the famous restaurant - the atmosphere on the large terrace right on the canal and the old building are convincing. As big fans of the K√ºhling & Battenfeld winery, we were very happy to be able to enjoy their own Riesling edition.\nThe food and service were excellent. We'd be happy to go again!', 'The dishes were, at least this time, very average. The starters were a good start, but the main courses (meat) were stringy and tough and the desserts were nothing special. We expected a lot more in this category. The service was friendly, if at times pushy (while we were still walking to the table, we were asked if we wanted sparkling wine or beer).', 'Excellent service (changes from 1 July), outstanding food, great wine selection and very good value for money.\nThe individual courses were not only particularly delicious, but also made us want to try the rest of the menu.', 'Simply wonderful. If you can't travel, you should stop here and let yourself be pampered.\nThe advice was very well-founded and both the sparkling wine and the accompanying wine were on point.\n\nThe food was simply fantastic and the ambience very tasteful.', 'Fantastic cuisine from a young team with a lot of potential. The overall picture of the quality of the food, service and interior is absolutely convincing.\nI have often eaten less well in Michelin-starred restaurants and at significantly higher prices. The Rutz Zollhaus is now more than an insider tip.', 'Very good restaurant with a location right on the water. Modern, really fine cuisine, the advice from the service was competent and supportive. All in all a successful visit, recommended if you want to see something different on a Sunday afternoon than the usual. We will be back.', 'Overall very good and the wine accompaniment was also top notch. The main course was a bit too cold.

We will definitely be back!', 'Simply great, sophisticated and very attractively presented food, with friendly and personable service in a stimulating atmosphere. The ""surprise"" menu is highly recommended. We are very satisfied and would be happy to come back.', 'The Rutz Zollhaus perfectly organized our wedding reception in the beautiful barn with an extremely courteous approach. The 6-course menu and the excellent wine accompaniment were a real highlight - varied, creative and a wonderful surprise for our guests from abroad. The tasteful and lovingly designed interior contributed to the festive atmosphere. The The team's helpfulness and attention to detail were impressive, especially with the decoration, where we received great support.\n\nA big thank you to Ms. Pia Negri and the entire team for this unforgettable evening!', 'Very tasty surprise menu. Very good service. Clear recommendation.', 'On the whole, everything was perfect here, but I would still tend to give it a four-star rating overall.\n\nThe restaurant is something special, a half-timbered house in the middle of Kreuzberg. The interior is modern with a visible dry-age cabinet. You can also see the chefs at work behind it.\n\nThe restaurant was half full. The acoustics were fine, in such flat rooms the wording is often over the top.\nThe menu is quite Belgian in terms of wording, which the dishes are not in the presentation.\n\nThere were two of us and we opted for the ""full table"". This is either a selection of 3, 5 or seven starters. When we decided to have three starters each, we asked if we could have three different ones each. We wanted to leave it up to the kitchen to decide which ones they would be. We were told no, we could only have the same selection of starters. I found that a little strange, because I wonder what would have happened if we had chosen this selection of three with starters that we had already selected. Would that have been said no to us too.\n\nThe starter selection was also called ""full table"", which suggests to me that the starters were all set at the same time. In the end, we were served a menu whose size was more reminiscent of a tasting menu and had nothing to do with a full table. We didn't like that either.\n\nThe quality and taste of all the dishes on offer was perfect and on point. The tartare, the beetroot and the black pudding are all great interpretations that make you want more.\n\nThe waiting times between the individual courses, however, are not. A good ten to fifteen minutes passed between the starters. As I said, everything together would have been great and so we spent almost an hour with the small starters. There was another very long wait for the main course.\n\nA top performance from the kitchen too, although in times of food waste I am not at all a fan of cutting chicken breasts straight and then withholding the premium sections from the guest. Just my two cents.\n\nThe service was, let's say, mixed.\nEvery time someone started, someone interrupted the very lively conversation to introduce the course. I can understand the gesture of wanting to introduce the course to the guest, but not necessarily wanting to interrupt the guest's flow of speech.\n\nIn addition to the waiting times, the cash register crashed, which we understood, but not the annoyed attitude when we asked for a split bill.\n\nSo w a lovely evening is unnecessarily spoiled at the end because we ask ourselves what is so abnormal about splitting the bill.\n\nOf course we suspect that the cash register system puts an additional burden on the staff, which is just how it has been channeled.\n\nFair enough.\n\nFor me the concept is a very good one, although the fine dining character bothers me here. For me a full table is a full table like in the BRLO and not a tasting menu in stages. Maybe they can change that on the menu. The kitchen craftsmanship is superb. Keep it up.\n\nPS: In terms of corona, everything is taken care of here, so that the guest does not have to worry.', 'A very charming half-timbered house, located directly on the Landwehrkanal, tempts with delicacies. The food is excellent, extremely tasty and attractively presented. The menu is filled with regional specialties. We were completely satisfied and enjoyed the idyllic atmosphere. The old customs house has fair prices, so we would be happy to come back.', 'Delicious culinary creations paired with first-class service = a perfect evening! üòÄüëçüèª', 'Excellent service in a very pleasant ambience, a very well-composed menu with very good wine accompaniment.

I booked in good time In March we booked a table for 2, which we then occupied at the beginning of July. When I made the reservation I had already decided on the Zollhaus menu, which surprises you. Not a negative surprise at all, because the chef personally asked at the table about intolerances and no-go's. Our waitress ""Sissy"" was very accommodating, polite and humorous. Her wine recommendation to go with the meal was excellent. The menu consisted of 5 courses and, as you would expect in such establishments, the portions were small. All courses were of high quality and you could see and of course taste the love and experience that went into the course. The ambience was not intrusive but very pleasant and just right. The prices are fair and in line with the quality. All in all, the price/performance ratio is more than great and justified. The good service and the work in the kitchen simply have to be honored.

The remaining remains of the monastery buildings were secured until the 1960s and later demolished as part of the expansion of Grunerstrasse.

Now the ruins of the monastery church are once again receiving a much-noticed urban development with the current development plan, which aims to build on historical layouts of Berlin in the area around the monastery quarter and the Molkenmarkt. spatial significance. The archaeological survey of the historic monastery complex has discovered well-preserved foundations of the cloister and chapter house on the north wall of the ruins, which make Berlin's city history impressive.\n\nHow these structural remains are to be made permanently visible and clearly communicated to the public is an important part of the workshop phase, which is currently being developed as a kind of ""temporary monument academy"".

The vast majority of the species here do not have enough space and enrichment in their enclosures, where you can see a lot of the animals are exhibiting behaviors reflected by this.

Visitors were seen using flash photography, banging on the windows and even children were running laps in the cat and monkey buildings - there was not a soul to be seen to remove these people for not respecting the rules. The only creatures which I can say had appropriate space were the ants, and that's only because they had a large tunnel system around the roof of the aquarium building! Accessibility around the place was lacking. I know most of Berlin has cobblestone streets but it is a nightmare for people who have wheelchairs, pushchairs and walking aids. It would be better to have a smooth path alongside the cobblestones so people with access needs can use them. Toilets and benches were few and far between too. I didn't see any water fountains around the zoo, so make sure to bring plenty of refreshments. There were a lot of litter bins so the visitor areas are relatively clean. We bought tickets on the day and it came to around ‚Ç¨80 for two adults (zoo and aquarium access), I believe it would be much cheaper booking in advance online. We also asked the reception (it was called the service desk or station?) if there was a cloakroom or some lockers to put bags and coats and they said no, only to reach the aquarium at the end of the visit and find out they did actually have a cloakroom.

Some of the cages were empty as some renovation work was going on or some animals were not available at that point of time but such were very fewer instances considering the size of the zoo. So no complaints on that front. \n\nIt took almost 3.5 hours to finish it without visiting aquarium(They charge it separately for aquarium).\n\nOverall good experience especially for children they were excited to see so many different species of animal.\n\nDo recommend it .

The square has a rich history and is considered one of the most significant landmarks in the country.\n\nThe Platz der Republik was initially known as the K√∂nigsplatz (King\'s Square) during the time of the German Empire. After the end of World War I, the square was renamed ""Platz der Republik"" (Square of the Republic) in honor of the newly formed Weimar Republic, which was established in 1919. The square was designed to serve as a symbolic center for the new democratic state, and it was intended to represent the values ‚Äã‚Äãof freedom and democracy.\n\nThe Platz der Republik is characterized by its vast open space, which is flanked by a series of impressive buildings. The most prominent of these is the Reichstag building, which stands at the northern end of the square. The Reichstag is the seat of the German parliament and has played a significant role in German history. The building was first constructed in 1894 and was extensively renovated after the reunification of Germany in 1990.\n\nThe Reichstag building is famous for its distinctive glass dome, which offers stunning views of the city. The dome was added to the building during the renovation in the 1990s and is a popular tourist attraction in its own right. Visitors can climb to the top of the dome and enjoy panoramic views of Berlin while learning about the history of the building and the German parliament.\n\nAnother important building located on the Platz der Re Public is the Paul L√∂be Haus. The Paul L√∂be Haus is the home of the Bundestag, the lower house of the German parliament. The building was completed in 2001 and is named after the German politician Paul L√∂be, who was a prominent member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany.\n\nThe Platz der Republik is also home to several other notable buildings, including the Marie-Elisabeth -L√ºders-Haus and the Jakob-Kaiser-Haus. These buildings are used by the Bundestag for administrative and support functions.\n\nThe square itself is a popular gathering place for locals and tourists alike. The open space is often used for cultural events, concerts, and demonstrations. During the summer months, the Platz der Republik is a popular spot for picnics and outdoor activities.\n\nOne of the most significant events in recent German history took place on the Platz der Republik in 1989. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Hundreds of thousands of people gathered on the square to celebrate the reunification of Germany. The event was marked by speeches and performances from prominent figures, including former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.\n\nOverall, the Platz der Republik is a significant symbol of German history and democracy. Its prominent location and impressive architecture make it a popular tourist attraction, while its role as the home of the German parliament ensures that it remains a vital center for the country\'s political life.', 'Very good old views masterpiece', ' Pretty spot to chill with friends', 'nice park to walk around and get mesmerized.\nif you want to visit the building, you will need to carry your passport t.\nBook in advance for a chance to get in', 'I love the architecture at this place.

It is located between Scharnhorststrasse and the Berlin-Spandau Shipping Canal, north of the Federal Ministry of Economics. The complex is one of the oldest cemeteries in Berlin and is regarded as a testament to Prussian and German military history as well as a memorial to the German Wars of Liberation from 1813 to 1815.\n\nDestruction towards the end of the Second World War and during the GDR era, when part of the Berlin Wall ran through the cemetery, has meant that only around 230 graves have been preserved on the 2.54 hectare site. A support association of the cemetery has been working to preserve and restore the complex and graves since 1992.\nDue to the historical and cultural significance of the entire complex and individual grave monuments, the Invalids Cemetery is listed as a garden monument.\n\nIn 1746, King Frederick II of Prussia had an invalids' home built near the Charit√©, in a largely uninhabited and desolate area northeast of the city area surrounded by the Berlin customs wall. Since its opening on November 15, 1748, it has housed war invalids. They were to be as self-sufficient as possible through agriculture, but in doing so they were also to help protect the area known locally as the ""Sahara"". e area to cultivate.\nThe original cemetery was probably fenced in, but otherwise had no decorations or path markings. A comprehensive design of cemeteries with the development of a separate cemetery culture and park-like facilities did not begin in Prussia until 1794. In that year the ""General Land Law of the Prussian States"" came into force, which prohibited burials in churches and inhabited urban areas. By 1872, 18,000 burials had taken place on the site of today's Invalids Cemetery; in the entire history of the cemetery there were around 30,000.

During the era of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), the Neue Wache underwent significant changes in its symbolism and function. In this article, we explore the transformation of the Neue Wache during the GDR period, highlighting its evolving role as a symbol of remembrance and political narrative.\n\nHistorical Background:\nOriginally built in 1816 as a guardhouse, the Neue Wache\' s purpose shifted over time. It served as a memorial to the fallen soldiers of the Napoleonic Wars and later became a memorial for the victims of World War I. The architectural design, with its neoclassical elements, evokes a sense of solemnity and reverence.\n\nMemorialization During the GDR Era:\nIn the aftermath of World War II, the Neue Wache took on new significance in the GDR era. The East German government sought to reshape the memorial's narrative to align with its political ideology. The focus shifted to commemorating victims of fascism, imperialism, and war, with an emphasis on portraying the GDR as a defender of peace and socialism.\n\nCentral Memorial Room:\nDuring the GDR period, the interior of the Neue Wache was redesigned to accommodate a central memorial room. The room housed a sculpture titled ""Mother with her Dead Son"" by K√§the Kollwitz, a renown ed German artist. The sculpture depicted a grieving mother cradling her lifeless son, symbolizing the immense human suffering caused by war and tyranny.\n\nPolitical Symbolism and Propaganda:\nWhile the Neue Wache was intended to honor the victims of war, it also became a tool for political propaganda in the GDR era. The government used the memorial to reinforce the narrative of the GDR as the legitimate successor to the anti-fascist resistance and to highlight the alleged threat posed by Western imperialism.\n\nChanging Narratives and Unification:\nWith the fall of the Berlin Wall in In 1989 and the subsequent reunification of Germany, the Neue Wache\'s narrative underwent another transformation. The reunified German government sought to redefine the memorial as a space for remembrance and reconciliation, acknowledging the victims of all wars and totalitarian regimes.\n\nContemporary Significance:\nToday, the Neue Wache continues to serve as a memorial to the victims of war and oppression. The central memorial room, now redesigned, houses the sculpture ""Mother with her Dead Son"" and serves as a space for contemplation and reflection. The memorial stands as a symbol of the complexities of history and the importance of remembering and learning from past atrocities. Usefull?

Originally established in the 16th century, Lustgarten has served as a public gathering place, a site for political rallies and demonstrations, and a place for cultural and artistic events throughout its history.\n\nThe name ""Lustgarten"" translates to ""pleasure garden"" in English, and the park was originally designed as a royal pleasure garden for the Elector of Brandenburg in the 16th century. Over the centuries, the park has been expanded and transformed, serving a variety of different functions.\n\nDuring the 19th and early 20th centuries, Lustgarten was an important site for political rallies and demonstrations. It was here that the Social Democratic Party of Germany held its first public demonstration in 1875, and it was also the site of a mass rally in 1914, at the outbreak of World War I.\n\nIn the years following World War II, Lustgarten was largely destroyed during the Battle of Berlin, and it remained in a state of disrepair for many years. However, in the years following G erman reunification, the park was restored to its former glory and once again became a popular gathering place for locals and tourists alike.\n\nToday, Lustgarten is a beautiful and serene public park, located just steps away from some of Berlin\'s most famous landmarks, including the Berlin Cathedral and the Museum Island complex. Visitors can stroll along the park's paths, take in the views of the surrounding architecture, and relax on the park's expansive lawns.\n\nIn addition to its natural beauty, Lustgarten is also home to a number of important cultural and historical landmarks. One of the most notable is the Berlin Palace, which is currently being rebuilt after being destroyed during World War II. The palace was the former home of the Prussian monarchs and served as an important political and cultural center for centuries.\n\nOther notable Landmarks in Lustgarten include the Old National Gallery, which houses an extensive collection of 19th-century art, and the Humboldt Forum, which is home to a range of cultural exhibitions and events.\n\nWhether you\'re looking to take in some history, relax in a beautiful natural setting, or simply enjoy the vibrant atmosphere of one of Berlin\'s most iconic public spaces, Lustgarten is a must-visit destination for anyone traveling to this vibrant city."", 'A charming public square surrounded by a museum and the Berlin Cathedral.

In 1742 he instructed the architect Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff to tear down the fences that surrounded the territory and to turn the park into a pleasure garden (literally ""p leasure garden""), one that would be open to the people of Berlin. In the baroque style popular at the time he added flowerbeds, borders and espaliers in geometrical layouts, along with mazes, water basins and ornamental ponds; he also commissioned sculptures to add cultural significance. Unique to the time period, areas of congregation called ""salons"" were established along the many different walkways in the park. These salons were blocked off from the walking path by hedges or trees and often furnished with seating, fountains and vases, offering guests a change of pace and a place to discuss intellectual matters in private. Such freedom was common under the rule of Frederick II; there were even residents allowed to live within the Tiergarten from the French, were allowed to erect tents and sell refreshments to the pedestrians walking through the park. A pheasant house was erected, which would later become the core of the Zoological Garden, a zoo founded in 1844 that lies within the greater Tiergarten. During the revolutions of 1848, the park hosted the first assembly demanding the abolishment of the national censors.', 'Lovely park to escape from berlin in berlin.

The bridge was rebuilt between 1928 and 1930 to accommodate the U8 line of the Berlin subway and to create an important connection between the U8 and U5 lines.\n\nThe U8 line opened on April 18, 1930, using the newly rebuilt Jannowitz Bridge as one of its central hubs.

In 1742 he instructed the architect Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff to tear down the fences that surrounded the territory and to turn the park into a pleasure garden (literally ""p leasure garden""), one that would be open to the people of Berlin. In the baroque style popular at the time he added flowerbeds, borders and espaliers in geometrical layouts, along with mazes, water basins and ornamental ponds; he also commissioned sculptures to add cultural significance. Unique to the time period, areas of congregation called ""salons"" were established along the many different walkways in the park. These salons were blocked off from the walking path by hedges or trees and often furnished with seating, fountains and vases, offering guests a change of pace and a place to discuss intellectual matters in private. Such freedom was common under the rule of Frederick II; there were even residents allowed to live within the Tiergarten from the French, were allowed to erect tents and sell refreshments to the pedestrians walking through the park. A pheasant house was erected, which would later become the core of the Zoological Garden, a zoo founded in 1844 that lies within the greater Tiergarten. During the revolutions of 1848, the park hosted the first assembly demanding the abolishment of the national censors.', 'Lovely park to escape from berlin in berlin.

', 'Platz der Republik is a famous public square in Berlin, Germany. It is located in the western part of the city, adjacent to the famous Brandenburg Gate and the iconic Reichstag building. The square has a rich history and is considered one of the most significant landmarks in the country.\n\nThe Platz der Republik was initially known as the K√∂nigsplatz (King\'s Square) during the time of the German Empire. After the end of World War I, the square was renamed ""Platz der Republik"" (Square of the Republic) in honor of the newly formed Weimar Republic, which was established in 1919. The square was designed to serve as a symbolic center for the new democratic state, and it was intended to represent the values ‚Äã‚Äãof freedom and democracy.\n\nThe Platz der Republik is characterized by its vast open space, which is flanked by a series of impressive buildings. The most prominent of these is the Reichstag building, which stands at the northern end of the square. The Reichstag is the seat of the German parliament and has played a significant role in German history. The building was first constructed in 1894 and was extensively renovated after the reunification of Germany in 1990.\n\nThe Reichstag building is famous for its distinctive glass dome, which offers stunning views of the city. The dome was added to the building during the renovation in the 1990s and is a popular tourist attraction in its own right. Visitors can climb to the top of the dome and enjoy panoramic views of Berlin while learning about the history of the building and the German parliament.\n\nAnother important building located on the Platz der Re Public is the Paul L√∂be Haus. The Paul L√∂be Haus is the home of the Bundestag, the lower house of the German parliament. The building was completed in 2001 and is named after the German politician Paul L√∂be, who was a prominent member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany.\n\nThe Platz der Republik is also home to several other notable buildings, including the Marie-Elisabeth -L√ºders-Haus and the Jakob-Kaiser-Haus. These buildings are used by the Bundestag for administrative and support functions.\n\nThe square itself is a popular gathering place for locals and tourists alike. The open space is often used for cultural events, concerts, and demonstrations. During the summer months, the Platz der Republik is a popular spot for picnics and outdoor activities.\n\nOne of the most significant events in recent German history took place on the Platz der Republik in 1989. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Hundreds of thousands of people gathered on the square to celebrate the reunification of Germany. The event was marked by speeches and performances from prominent figures, including former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.\n\nOverall, the Platz der Republik is a significant symbol of German history and democracy. Its prominent location and impressive architecture make it a popular tourist attraction, while its role as the home of the German parliament ensures that it remains a vital center for the country's political life.', 'Very good old views masterpiece', ' Pretty spot to chill with friends', 'nice park to walk around and get mesmerized.\nif you want to visit the building, you will need to carry your passport t.\nBook in advance for a chance to get in', 'I love the architecture at this place.

This was to make room for a highway, the so-called ""Westtangente"". Part of the cemetery where prisoners were buried was deconsecrated and used as an allotment garden. Only the officials' cemetery has survived to this day. Here the prison officials were buried separately from the prisoners. In the years that followed, the site was used provisionally as a storage area, scrap yard and by car repair shops. From 1970 to 1973, a block of flats was built on the site of the former main entrance to the prison, and from 1973 to 1974, a parking garage was built. Four of the seven official residences were demolished for this purpose. The rest of the area was initially to make way for a motorway. Later plans envisaged a block-like development, and finally a residential development with green space.

The historical significance of the site was now recognized and plans for today's history park began. Two years later, the Berlin Senate listed the remaining parts of the approximately five-meter-high prison wall, the civil servants' cemetery and three of the civil servants' houses as historical monuments. However, reunification made these plans obsolete: the plan was now to run the Tiergarten tunnel over the site. After intensive discussions, however, these plans were changed so that the tunnel would end to the east of the site. Work began in 2003 under the direction of the Berlin landscape architecture firm Gla√üer and Dagenbach and was successfully completed with the opening on October 26, 2006.

Located on Museum Island in the heart of the city, this majestic cathedral is a masterpiece of Baroque and Renaissance Revival architecture, serving as both a religious and cultural symbol of the city.\n\nHistory\n\n‚Ä¢\tOrigins: The origins of the Berlin Cathedral date back to the 15th century when it was originally a modest parish church. Over time, the church underwent several reconstructions and expansions as it grew in importance. By the 19th century, King Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia envisioned a grand cathedral to reflect Prussia's power and Protestant faith, leading to the construction of the modern version of the cathedral.\n‚Ä¢\tCurrent Building (1905): The current Berlin Cathedral was completed in 1905, designed by architect Julius Carl Raschdorff. It was built in the Renaissance Revival style with Baroque elements, intended to rival St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. It became the main Protestant church for the royal Hohenzollern family and a key site for important religious and state ceremonies.\n‚Ä¢\tWorld War II and Reconstruction: During World War II, the Berlin Cathed ral was severely damaged by Allied bombing raids in 1944. The main dome collapsed, and much of the interior was destroyed. After the war, the cathedral stood in ruins until reconstruction began in the 1970s. It was finally restored to its former glory in 1993, although some parts of the original design, such as the 114-meter-tall dome, were simplified.\n\nArchitecture\n\n‚Ä¢\tExterior: The Berlin Cathedral is characterized by its striking green copper dome, imposing towers, and richly decorated fa√ßade. The grand entrance features a series of statues, reliefs, and columns that reflect its Renaissance influences. At the top of the cathedral, the 98-meter-high dome offers breathtaking views of the Berlin skyline and the surrounding Museum Island, one of the city's most picturesque areas.\n‚Ä¢\tInterior: Inside, the cathedral is just as impressive, with lavishly decorated ceilings, stained-glass windows, and intricate mosaics. The Sermon Hall (Preaching Church) is the largest part of the interior, with room for 1,500 worshipers, and is used for services, concerts, and events. One of the highlights of the interior is the grand Sauer Organ, which has over 7,000 pipes and is one of the largest organs in Germany.\n‚Ä¢\tHohenzollern Crypt: Beneath the cathedral lies the Hohenzollern Crypt, which contains the tombs of Prussian kings , queens, and royals from the Hohenzollern dynasty. It is one of the most significant dynastic burial sites in Europe, with over 90 sarcophagi, including those of Friedrich I and his wife, Sophie Charlotte.\n\nReligious and Cultural Role\n\n‚Ä¢\tProtestant Church: The Berlin Cathedral is the largest Protestant church in Germany and serves as the central church of the Evangelical Church of Berlin-Brandenburg. It remains an active place of worship, hosting regular services, baptisms, weddings, and funerals, as well as important ecumenical events.\n‚Ä¢\tConcerts and Events: Beyond its religious significance, the cathedral is renowned for its music and cultural programs. The impressive acoustics make it a popular venue for organ concerts, choral performances, and classical music events. The annual Christmas concert and other religious celebrations draw large crowds from around the world.\n\nDome Climb and Panoramic Views\n\nOne of the most popular activities for visitors is the climb to the top of the dome, which involves ascending 270 steps . The effort is rewarded with stunning 360-degree views of Berlin‚Äôs landmarks, including the nearby TV Tower, Museum Island, and the Brandenburg Gate. The observation deck also provides a closer look at the intricate mosaics and sculptures that adorn the cathedral‚Äôs exterior.', 'Berlin Cathedral is a must see in the city!

The park is named after the vineyard that once stood on the site in the 19th century.\n\nThe vineyard was established in the mid-19th century by the French wine merchant Jean Jacques Bouch√©, who saw an opportunity to produce wine in the fertile soil of the area. The vineyard was successful for a time, but it eventually fell into disuse and was abandoned.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the site was transformed into a public park. The park was designed in the English landscape style, with winding paths, open lawns, and numerous trees and shrubs. During World War II, the park suffered significant damage and was largely destroyed.\n\nAfter the war, the park was restored and became a popular gathering place for local residents. In the 1960s, the park was renovated again and new facilities were added, including a playground and sports fields.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Weinbergspark became an important center of Berlin's alternative culture scene. The park was a popular gathering place for artists, musicians, and activists, and it was the site of numerous political demonstrations and cultural events.\n\nAfter the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the park underwent another round of renovations and was expanded to include a new amphitheater and community garden. Today, Weinbergspark remains a popular destination for locals and tourists alike. The park features a large playground, sports fields, and numerous paths for walking and jogging.

But you could make a lot more of it, couldn't you? Some of the green areas here are suitable for urban gardening.... The climbing park with the Trabi and the Beetle as a symbol of the historic location not far from the Berlin Wall Memorial is already a Eye-catcher and very popular in summer. As are the countless beach volleyball courts behind it.\n\nI have to correct myself: this is becoming increasingly unpopular for dog owners - the district authority apparently thinks it's cool to send guards after us here to monitor the leash requirement. Where in Mitte are the dogs supposed to run around? They get restless and a lot more happens if you don't let them. We don't have a proper place to run around in this district, at least not one that deserves the name. One of the three spots that our four-legged friends are allowed to run around here has even been completely closed.\nAnd, between you and me: the dogs stay among themselves and leave passers-by in peace on the lawn. People meet up, the dogs play and romp around and the poop is dutifully removed. What's the problem???\nThe person responsible for this in the district administration must be a real dog hater. I'm sorry, I can't think of any other explanation.\nOh, and PS: your henchmen, ladies and gentlemen from the district office, should at least know the laws. The dog law, ¬ß 26 in particular. The rest of the paragraphs would be helpful too.\nThanks for the guards anyway, though. So far the park has remained drug dealer-free. Or at least they aren't there too often... That's good, because drug dealing is illegal and should be combated. But dogs, dear fellow human beings, aren't. So there's no need to combat them. Impose a fine for leaving poop lying around, that's disgusting too. But leave our dogs alone if they're not hurting anyone. If a passer-by is scared, we put them on a leash ourselves.

I tried calling several times, the drivers behind me were also getting angry, but the employee always simply hung up and said the car park was full. Incompetence on the part of the train company, and dangerous when you have to return your rental car and don't have much time left to catch your train.

Huge spaces, mix of incompatible materials and simplification in every detail.', ""The Paul-L√∂be-Haus, often referred to simply as the L√∂be Building, is a prominent government building in Berlin, Germany. It is an integral part of the German parliamentary complex known as the Reichstag quarter. The building's name honors Paul L√∂be, a German politician who played a significant role in the Weimar Republic and later served in the post-war Bundestag (Federal Diet).\nArchitectural Significance:\nDesigned by architect Stephan Braunfels, the Paul-L√∂be-Haus is a modern architectural marvel. Its design harmoniously blends contemporary elements with the historic context of the Reichstag building nearby. The fa√ßade is characterized by its glass and steel structure, which gives it a striking and transparent appearance.\n\nFunction and Purpose:\nThe Paul-L√∂be-Haus primarily serves as an office building for members of the Bundestag, the German federal parliament It houses the offices of many Members of Parliament (MPs), committee rooms, and administrative spaces. The proximity of the Paul-L√∂be-Haus to the Reichstag building is symbolic of the close working relationship between the legislative and executive branches of the German government.\n\nConnection to the Reichstag:\nThe Paul-L√∂be-Haus is connected to the Reichstag building by an underground tunnel. This tunnel allows MPs to easily move between the two buildings, facilitating their work in both the parliamentary sessions held in the Reichstag and theirs daily office tasks in the Paul-L√∂be-Haus.\n\nSustainability and Energy Efficiency:\nThe building incorporates several sustainable and energy-efficient features, including natural ventilation and lighting. Its eco-friendly design aligns with Germany's commitment to environmental sustainability.\n\nAccessibility and Public Engagement:\nWhile primarily a workspace for parliamentarians, the Paul-L√∂be-Haus is accessible to the public to some extent. Visitors can attend committee meetings, and there are guided tours available for those interested in the architecture and history of the building.\n\nRole in German Politics:\nThe Paul-L√∂be-Haus, along with the neighboring Marie-Elisabeth-L√ºders- Haus, plays a crucial role in facilitating the legislative process in Germany. It provides the necessary infrastructure and space for MPs to conduct their parliamentary duties effectively.\n\nOverall, the Paul-L√∂be-Haus is not only a functional government building but also a symbol of Germany's commitment to transparency, sustainability, and the democratic process . Its modern design and integration into the historic Reichstag quarter make it a significant landmark in Berlin and an essential part of the country's political landscape."", 'The architecture tour is exceptionally good.

At least five other people had the same problems. If you have to go there, please don't eat it. The staff are rude and shouted several times and scolded us for things we couldn't have known.

You were treated unfairly and shouted at for no reason.\nThe visit was the biggest waste of time of my life!', 'Very poor place, apart from the architecture there is nothing to really admire. When serving food, one member of staff thought she had to guess the visitors' educational background (shouting to call people Waldorf students, e.g. when someone took a slice of bread - from a packet! - without tongs). But we can see who is slaving away the last years of their lives in the soup kitchen there.\n\nWell, I guess they still can't do the job. Colleagues who ate the pasta felt sick - they described it to me as sticky, possibly from the day before, and the sauce was watery. I ate the vegetarian version of the potato soup, and it had neither taste (but the staff's hair did), nor was it filling - drinks we got also had a strange beige tasty.\n\nIf you want to eat and actually keep it in your stomach at the end, you should avoid doing that here, especially since the service is of a similar quality to the food.

There we were told that it was their mistake and that we should have gone to them beforehand.

On top of that, the so-called ""food"" consisted of jarred tomato sauce and frozen cake. Simply disappointing! The staff were also exclusively rude and did not accommodate the guests' wishes. Sayings like, ""Do we have to have another 40 of you come?"" spoiled our mood from the start. You are not allowed to stand at the apparently unlimited drinks stand for more than 10 seconds and are sent away with extremely rude comments.

Had two drinks at the little bar while waiting for the sun to go down, good time to visit just before sunset so you can see Berlin by day and night! Clean toilets, strict security but all well organized"", ""What a cool experience! I highly recommend anyone coming to Berlin to check out this place. It's super easy to purchase tickets at the kiosk outside. There's only a small wait before going up the elevators to the top depending on how busy it is. There's 2 separate lines, one for the view and one for the actual restaurant (which I didn't go to). Either way, once at the top, you are greeted with a beautiful 360 degree view of the city. I could see so much I would usually miss if not seeing it from above. I wanted to go around sunset to make the view even better and it definitely did not disappoint. There is a bar up top that features a select offering of drinks. I tried their margarita and it was pretty tasty but of course price on top of the ticket of admission. Definitely stop by here to see some amazing views of Berlin!"", ""I want to share with you all about my recent visit to the Berlin TV Tower. If you're planning a trip to Berlin, this is definitely a must-visit place.\n\nThe TV Tower stands tall at 368 meters, making it the tallest building in the city. Upon entering, you'll be amazed by the beautiful interior design and the futuristic vibe of the tower. But the real highlight of the experience is the rotating restaurant located at the top of the tower.\nNot only does it offer delicious food, but it also provides a 360-degree view of the entire city. It's truly a mesmerizing experience, seeing all of Berlin from above. The city looks particularly stunning at night when all the lights are on.\nSo if you're looking for a unique and unforgettable dining experience with a breathtaking view, make sure to add the Berlin TV Tower to your itinerary. Trust me, you won't regret it."", 'Great view! Lift only takes 40 seconds to reach the 350 odd meters up. Drink prices are sky high just like the tower so just be aware!', 'I really enjoy traveling to the top of the tower and experiencing the views it provides of Berlin. But I would encourage buying tickets early because there can be a long queue of people waiting for their time to travel to the top wait like walking over to the Rote Rathaus and St. Mary's church.\nI definitely think the TV Tower is worth the visit."", 'Had lunch in the TV tower, they allow you in about 15 mins prior to your reservation time - limited tickets available but we had no issue getting a same day lunch ticket. Quick walk through security brings you to an elevator which zooms you to the top. Once you locate your table, you have a reservation for 2 hours. The views are absolutely breathtaking is so high. It enables you t o have a 360 view of the whole city. Unfortunately it was a bit cloudy when we visited because it was still early in the morning. But nevertheless we were also able to enjoy.', 'Excellent and must do landmark of Berlin. You are able to see everything from top, and if it is a clear day you can see for hundreds of miles over 360 degrees. I also recommend the VR experience in the lobby to understand the history of Berlin since its inception until the unification.', 'A wonderful experience to see Berlin from above. Along the perimeter there are descriptions of the most outstanding buildings that you see in front of you.\n\nWe visited the tower on a weekday, so there were fewer people and more freedom to see everything. Even fog and rain could not interfere with this. As a cherry on the cake - take a delicious cocktail in the bar at the top and enjoy the moment.', 'Best view over Berlin. Prices are fine for this experience. So don't miss to look through the glads when going up and down with the elevator. VR experience was also very well made and informative. Book your ticket with a time slot then you do not wait at all.', 'Standing under the Berlin TV Tower, I couldn't help but think: we're all just tiny dots worrying about tiny things. From up there, no one can see your bad day, your bad mood, or your bad hair‚Äîkinda makes you feel better, doesn't it?\n\nNote: Try to avoid going here during New Year's Eve as there are lots of fireworks going around horizontally.

If you don't buy tickets in advance get there first thing when they open. We were able to go straight up but the next three time windows were sold out.', 'What an amazing view of Berlin. The moment you enter you get a feeling of the grandiose Soviet Era of Germany and what the West has now transformed from an iconic socialism symbol into a money making machine. East meets West on a monumental scale. A must visit if you are in Berlin', 'This i s a historical place plus an amazing view of the city like no other. Yes, it is a bit pricey at 27 euros per adult but you can go up to the observation deck and take your time there. There's a restaurant up there but I just chose the observation deck. Even then, there was a bar with sandwiches and snacks, plus some seating. You can easily make that 27 euros worthwhile. There is a slightly more expensive package which involves a VR experience down on the lobby if you‚Äôre so inclined. There is also a gift shop at the lobby where you can find all kinds of souvenirs of the TV tower and Berlin.\nI highly recommend this visit, just make sure you have plenty of time and are not in a rush.', ""Not great. Way too crowded, they let too many people go up which makes the viewing on the observation deck unpleasant, with people bumping into you constantly. So taking good pictures is a challenge prevent you from seeing panorama view, which is a shame. That said, the view itself is pretty good, but do note that Berlin doesn't have a lot of high buildings, which might make it less interesting for those expecting an overwhelming view annoying that you need to show your ticket at least three times during the whole thing, once should be enough. Security measures are as tight as an airport's. On a positive note, the Lego model of the Berlin city center (visible in the main lobby ) is pretty neat.\n\nIn short, more of a tourist trap than a nice excursion. Wouldn't recommend."", 'Whenever I am abroad I can never resist a viewing deck, and this one didn't disappoint.

Its visibility from many parts of the city makes it a prominent landmark and an important part of Berlin's cultural and architectural heritage.', 'We could see this iconic tower from all over Berlin. I was keen to see it close-up as it reminded me of the Post Office Tower in London.\n\nWe did not go inside, but I love these old buildings.', 'Nice midday activity, it can get very crowded, bar is also available a restaurant but booked with a different ticket.

Had breakfast in the restaurant that revolves to give a view of the whole city\n\nAmazing experience', 'The experience at the TV Tower was alright. It offers a great view of most of Berlin, which I imagine would be stunning on a clear day. Unfortunately, during my visit, it was quite cloudy outside, and the interior felt too dark, which slightly impacted the overall experience.\n\nWhile it was an enjoyable visit, I couldn't help but compare it to similar attractions in other countries , and I expected a bit more from Berlin. Overall, it was okay, but not as im pressive as I had hoped.', 'Booked a table for two for the Thursday evening. It was 47 euros just for the pleasure of booking said table.  The food was ok. Nothing spectacular. The view however was and we thoroughly enjoyed that experience overall. We do feel that if you are booking a table for dinner and are spending 150 plus euros on the not great food and drink we don‚Äôt feel you should have to pay 47 euros to book the table; this should be significantly reduced or even free.\n\nAmar our lovely waiter really did make our evening special. He was kind, attentive and took great care of us.', 'No queue time with online reservation. By coincidence, we came up just as the sun set over the city which was a spectacle to watch.

Extremely poor customer service especially considering we pre-paid tickets at ‚Ç¨25 each.', 'One of the most iconic places in Berlin!  In summer, there can be long queues, so it is recommended to go to the tower in spring or autumn.', 'Pricey but spectacular breakfast at the restaurant, definitely a fantastic addition to any visit!', 'The view certainly is nice , but the observatory platform is way too crowded. Walking around is hardly possible. So reserving a time slot seems pointless. Security measures are a bit exaggerated; camera tripods not allowed, why? Just moderate the amount of people allowed inside per time slot. All in all, too expensive for the experience. Feels a bit like a tourist trap.', 'There‚Äôs no reason for this to be so expensive. The view isn‚Äôt great (we went up at 5pm but it was already too dark to see anything) and we paid 43‚Ç¨ per person f or the view and a free drink.

Our group wasn‚Äôt the only ones at the bar complaining about the very obvious bait-and-switch. We did end up getting a cocktail (and it was good) but I think the whole experience was an expensive waste of time.', 'I visited lots of the main tourist attractions in Berlin and this was high on many lists so was looking forward to it. However it was probably the most disappointing. Few of the main negatives:\n\n- There is a lot of airport style security, multiple checkpoints, bags and people are scanned similar to the airport and getting up to the tower is very controlled and feels restrictive\n- The lift is fast but there was constrction work only 1 lift working and the lift itself was having work done to it as well\n- When at the viewing area only 1 level was open, so event even though we paid for the extra drinks and viewing area it was closed\n- The drink including in our premium ticket which costs an extra ‚Ç¨10 is not any drink at the bar but rather this list of just a few light sprinter type drinks so that was a waste\n- Having paid for the extras no one tells you or makes sure you get what you pay for and you sort of got to ask and find you want to get it\n- Barmen took about 15 mins to serve me and it was not that busy\n\nThe positives\n\n- The VR expierence was a nice little history lesson on Berlin\n- The views are amazing', 'It provides you a good 360 degree view of Berlin.

Lovely and cool staff and they also do a few special cocktails.\nWould definitely recommend this if you‚Äôre in Berlin. Even your Berlin tour is not complete if you never visit this TV tower.', 'EXPENSIVE! 90 euros for a family of four. But, may be worth a visit if you would like to get an impression of Berlin from above. The view is spectacular. There are toilets and a tourist shop inside. To get up to the tower you will need to pass a security check. The lift to the top was fast and smooth, but filled to its capacity. We visited in early March, which I assume is off season. In the high season I guess the queues are crazy.', ""Iconic place in Berlin, a must-see if you're around.\n\nWithout thinking about the iconic status, the price could be a bit better, it's 25‚Ç¨ for the most basic ticket.

We ate, enjoyed the view and left without tipping (in my case even without looking at the waiter). Worst experience in a while.\n\nLast but not least - the restaurant should really review the menu.

Overall, I recommend it once.', ""Towers are in my opinion are not much worth the price and in particular this one is worse of them all. Berlin does not have too many skyscrapers and as a result the view from above at night looks like a farm land. Most of commercial buildings don't leave their floor lights on different story. The viewing circle is very small and hot and with lights reflecting from the angled glass there is no way to get a good shot from above. In any event the $40 USD should be spent in better places. Did not try the restaurant so have no opinion on food Stick with New York Chrysler building or Chicago Sears tower and the skyline at night in those cities are far better viewing than Berlin. Also the machine at the site to charge and give you ticket does not work correctly and ended up charging me three times he can't do anything until Monday.

While I appreciated the experience, I did feel that the overall cost was a bit high considering what was offered , the view from the observatory was impressive, and I found that going close to sunset time enhanced the experience, providing an opportunity for stunning pictures.

In the baroque style popular at the time he added flowerbeds, borders and espaliers in geometrical layouts, along with mazes, water basins and ornamental ponds; he also commissioned sculptures to add cultural significance.

Such freedom was common under the rule of Frederick II; there were even residents allowed to live within the Tiergarten from the French, were allowed to erect tents and sell refreshments to the pedestrians walking through the park.

A special attraction that enchants visitors with its beauty, elegance and impressive statues is the Rose Garden. This idyllic refuge is a true gem in the middle of the vibrant metropolis.\n\nThe Rose Garden is located in the heart of the Tiergarten, close to the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag. It covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãapproximately 3,500 square meters and is home to an impressive collection of rose species from all over the world. But in addition to the beautiful roses, it is also the statues that make the garden something very special.\n\nAlong the winding paths and between the rose beds there are various statues that make the rose garden an artistic place. The statues represent mythological figures, historical personalities and allegorical representations. They blend harmoniously into the landscape and give the garden an additional artistic dimension.\n\nOne of the most famous statues in the rose garden is the ""Venus of Berlin"", a replica of the ancient Venus de Medici. This statue, which embodies grace and beauty, is a popular photo opportunity for visitors and gives the garden a romantic atmosphere. Another impressive statue is the ""Flora"", which represents the goddess of flowers and nature. With her elegant appearance and the flower tendrils that wind around her, she fits perfectly into the rose paradise.\n\nIn addition to these main statues, there are numerous other sculptures that decorate the rose garden. Each of them tells its own story and fascinates visitors with their artistic expressiveness. The statues give the garden a timeless beauty and remind us that the rose garden is not only a place of nature, but also a place of art.\n\nThe rose garden in Tiergarten Berlin therefore offers not only an impressive collection of roses, but also a fascinating variety of statues. The harmonious harmony between the rose beds and the artistic sculptures makes the garden a unique experience for the senses. Visitors can not only admire the beauty of roses, but also immerse themselves in the fascinating world of fine art.\n\nWhether for a romantic ical stroll, a picnic in the countryside or simply to unwind - the rose garden in Berlin's Tiergarten with its breathtaking roses and impressive statues has something special for every visitor.

In 1742 he instructed the architect Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff to tear down the fences that surrounded the territory and to turn the park into a pleasure garden (literally ""p leasure garden""), one that would be open to the people of Berlin. In the baroque style popular at the time he added flowerbeds, borders and espaliers in geometrical layouts, along with mazes, water basins and ornamental ponds; he also commissioned sculptures to add cultural significance. Unique to the time period, areas of congregation called ""salons"" were established along the many different walkways in the park. These salons were blocked off from the walking path by hedges or trees and often furnished with seating, fountains and vases, offering guests a change of pace and a place to discuss intellectual matters in private. Such freedom was common under the rule of Frederick II; there were even residents allowed to live within the Tiergarten from the French, were allowed to erect tents and sell refreshments to the pedestrians walking through the park. A pheasant house was erected, which would later become the core of the Zoological Garden, a zoo founded in 1844 that lies within the greater Tiergarten.

The vineyard was successful for a time, but it eventually fell into disuse and was abandoned.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the site was transformed into a public park. The park was designed in the English landscape style, with winding paths, open lawns, and numerous trees and shrubs. During World War II, the park suffered significant damage and was largely destroyed.\n\nAfter the war, the park was restored and became a popular gathering place for local residents. In the 1960s, the park was renovated again and new facilities were added, including a playground and sports fields.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Weinbergspark became an important center of Berlin's alternative culture scene. The park was a popular gathering place for artists, musicians, and activists, and it was the site of numerous political demonstrations and cultural events.\n\nAfter the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the park underwent another round of renovations and was expanded to include a new amphitheater and community garden.

Her excessive lifestyle always caused offense and attention. She literally attracted scandals, she took morphine and cocaine, drank a bottle of cognac a day and fought with every m that got in her way. Her lack of inhibitions embodied the wild urge of her generation to live without thinking about a future that was already lost. She had always been what the Germans became through inflation: wasteful. Not out of lavishness, but because she didn't care at all about the word future. This made her the idol of inflation, its goddess of death. In 1925 she posed completely naked for Otto Dix, who painted her as old as she ever was: emaciated, sunken, wrinkled, her mouth blood-red, her complexion pale and her eyes deathly dark. But she didn't just sell her body as a model, she also offered it physically for sale. Martha Dix: ""Someone spoke to her and she said '200 marks.' I didn't think that was so terrible. She had to earn money somehow."" Her dances[3], which were often performed naked, repeatedly led to tumultuous scenes during her performances. Anita Berber put an end to all Prussian discipline and was notorious for her unpunctuality and unreliability.

The place and the surroundings are worth seeing. Not as dirty as some people have described.\n\nThe former prison was demolished in 1957/58, except for a few prison walls and seven officials' houses in the northern area of ‚Äã‚Äãtoday's park. This was to make room for a highway, the so-called ""Westtangente"". Part of the cemetery where prisoners were buried was deconsecrated and used as an allotment garden. Only the officials' cemetery has survived to this day. Here the prison officials were buried separately from the prisoners. In the years that followed, the site was used provisionally as a storage area, scrap yard and by car repair shops. From 1970 to 1973, a block of flats was built on the site of the former main entrance to the prison, and from 1973 to 1974, a parking garage was built. Four of the seven official residences were demolished for this purpose. The rest of the area was initially to make way for a motorway. Later plans envisaged a block-like development, and finally a residential development with green space. In 1983, protests by citizens led to the plans for the construction of the western bypass not being pursued any further.\n\nAerial view of the remains of the cell prison, 1997\nSeven years later, a new development plan was drawn up. The historical significance of the site was now recognized and plans for today's history park began. Two years later, the Berlin Senate listed the remaining parts of the approximately five-meter-high prison wall, the civil servants' cemetery and three of the civil servants' houses as historical monuments. However, reunification made these plans obsolete: the plan was now to run the Tiergarten tunnel over the site. After intensive discussions, however, these plans were changed so that the tunnel would end to the east of the site. Work began in 2003 under the direction of the Berlin landscape architecture firm Gla√üer and Dagenbach and was successfully completed with the opening on October 26, 2006. In total, the city invested around 3.1 million euros in the park.', 'Oppressive. A memorial in the shadow of the bustling Berlin Central Station couldn't be more contrasting.

These features invite natural light, creating an atmosphere of accessibility and accountability, symbolic of the nation's open governance .\n\nHistorically, the edifice traces its roots back to the late 1800s, initially serving as the Prussian Crown Prince's Palace and later as residence for the German Emperors. However, war and political change led to its significant transformation.

Between two five-story administrative tracts, a 36-meter-high government building rises, housing the offices of the Chancellor and his ministers of state, the cabinet room, and several conference rooms, embodying the epicenter of German political discourse .\n\ nAccess to this citadel of German politics requires meticulous planning due to security protocols.

A special attraction that enchants visitors with its beauty, elegance and impressive statues is the Rose Garden. This idyllic refuge is a true gem in the middle of the vibrant metropolis.\n\nThe Rose Garden is located in the heart of the Tiergarten, close to the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag. It covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãapproximately 3,500 square meters and is home to an impressive collection of rose species from all over the world. But in addition to the beautiful roses, it is also the statues that make the garden something very special.\n\nAlong the winding paths and between the rose beds there are various statues that make the rose garden an artistic place. The statues represent mythological figures, historical personalities and allegorical representations. They blend harmoniously into the landscape and give the garden an additional artistic dimension.\n\nOne of the most famous statues in the rose garden is the ""Venus of Berlin"", a replica of the ancient Venus de Medici. This statue, which embodies grace and beauty, is a popular photo opportunity for visitors and gives the garden a romantic atmosphere. Another impressive statue is the ""Flora"", which represents the goddess of flowers and nature. With her elegant appearance and the flower tendrils that wind around her, she fits perfectly into the rose paradise.\n\nIn addition to these main statues, there are numerous other sculptures that decorate the rose garden. Each of them tells its own story and fascinates visitors with their artistic expressiveness. The statues give the garden a timeless beauty and remind us that the rose garden is not only a place of nature, but also a place of art.\n\nThe rose garden in Tiergarten Berlin therefore offers not only an impressive collection of roses, but also a fascinating variety of statues. The harmonious harmony between the rose beds and the artistic sculptures makes the garden a unique experience for the senses. Visitors can not only admire the beauty of roses, but also immerse themselves in the fascinating world of fine art.\n\nWhether for a romantic ical stroll, a picnic in the countryside or simply to unwind - the rose garden in Berlin's Tiergarten with its breathtaking roses and impressive statues has something special for every visitor.

In the early 1920s, the station was built on the corner of Friedrichstra√üe and Unter den Linden. In the 1960s, the financial resources for designing the stations were very limited, and so the underground stations that came into operation during this period did not have tiles or other decorative elements.

The apparent compromises and concessions raise doubts about their seriousness. A clear and determined stance from citizens is required to ensure that the principles laid down in the Basic Law are not lightly sacrificed. It is up to us, as informed members of society, to decisively oppose these worrying trends and stand up for responsible budgetary policy.\nIt is crucial that we as citizens remain vigilant and active in political matters, especially when it comes to fundamental principles such as the debt brake. If there are concerns that the government is watering down these principles, we should use our rights as informed members of society. An open and serious debate on political decisions is necessary to ensure that the interests of the population are adequately taken into account.\nThe debt brake in Germany is a constitutional provision enshrined in Articles 109 and 115 of the Basic Law. It was introduced in 2009 and aims to limit new borrowing by the federal and state governments. Here are the key points of the debt brake:\n\n1. **Debt ceiling:** G According to the debt brake, the federal states and the federal government are fundamentally prohibited from taking on new debt without exception. This means that budgets must generally be drawn up without a deficit.\n2. **Transitional periods:** However, there are transitional periods that allow the states to gradually move away from new debt. By 2020 at the latest, the states should draw up their budgets largely without net new debt.\n3. **Economic cycle exceptions:** The regulations allow exceptions in exceptional economic situations, for example in times of severe recessions. In such cases, the states and the federal government can temporarily take on debt.\n4. **Regulations at federal level:** From 2016, the federal government must generally draw up its budget without net borrowing. Here too, there are exceptions for natural disasters or exceptional emergency situations. Important! The introduction of the debt brake aims to stabilize public finances in the long term and promote sustainable budget policy. The aim is to prevent public debt from accumulating without limit in order to ensure the financial capacity of the state to secure.', 'pleasant atmosphere here, good working and conference climate', 'The federal headquarters of the B 90/The Greens party.\nExciting and interesting political events are held here regularly.', 'Given a nice and relaxed welcome.

Next came a lot of useless information and a lot of standing around in a small rooms. A lot of pointless walking, taking elevators, to just listening to the guide in landings of the floor.\n\nMost of that information was somewhat bit irrelevant, such as info about restaurants that opened in the building or every statistics per year how many passengers were flying in and out. This all can be shortened and not take 2 hours, in my opinion this tour is a bit too long.\n\nThis next issue that I had was with this specific guide and not with the tour. Before we started our tour I have noticed that other tour guide from other group was stressing the fact that most of the tour is inside of the building, therefore the masks must be worn at all the times while inside. Our guide didn't say anything about masks (he had one on his elbow) while having some cough once in a while. 3/4 of our group were not wearing any masks and that made me feel very uneasy around this tour.

Two hours, in my opinion is too long for this tour, can be done within one hour, just cut out all the walking around small rooms and staircases.\n\nOverall a cool place to visit, but think twice if you want to spent two hours standing around in small rooms. There were couple cool spots towards the end of the tour, I with they would just do those.\n\nThank you', ""I really have to hand to the city of Berlin. That they have resisted push of developers and have maintained this as a public use space is not only impressive, but very forward looking as this is a place that will always be unique and important and all set Berlin aside as a true champion of history. Now I have read some people complain that it's just a big empty lawn, etc it first glance it might seem that way. And that the people on their bikes go too fast and that frankly it's not the cleanest place in the world. But that is up to the people of Berlin to change. They know what they want and they will make the changes they see fit. I think it is a very iconic space and I would come back here in a heartbeat just to sit and look at the world around me and realize how much pain Germany has suffered in its history.

That said, the airport is worth a visit anyway to see the building itself.

Nazi took over in 1932 with the vision to expand it into the largest commercial airport in the world, which then turned into a weapon manufacturing forced labor camp. After WW2, USSR turned over the site to US army and civil aviation restarted in 1946.
